# Fuzzy Palz: Dog Trainer VR

Fuzzy Palz: Dog Trainer VR is a virtual reality simulation to assist in teaching users how to train a dog. It was built as part of an independent study and Educational Technologies course during my Georgia Tech Master's Degree program. Initially the simulation was built for the Oculus GearVR and later iterations added support for 6-degrees of freedom controllers and the Oculus Rift. It supports voice recognition, hand gestures, has teleport-based movement and mini-games like throwing a tennis ball for the dog to go fetch! Teach the virtual dog to sit, down, stay, come, and reward the dog to reinforce when it listens properly to the spoken command.
